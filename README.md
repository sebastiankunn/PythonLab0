idk basic stuff with python maybe someone needs them

yeah basically i had to do some basic exercises to get comfy with Python and idk maybe someone as noob as me can use them in some way

you can choose which one to execute by a switch, here's the index:

1. Accept two int values from the user and return their product. If the
product is greater than 1000, then return their sum.
2. Given a range of numbers. Iterate from i-th number to the end number
and print the sum of the current number and previous number.
3. Given a list of ints, return True if first and last number of a list is same
4. Given a list of numbers, Iterate it and print only those numbers which are
divisible of 5
5. Return the number of times that the string “Emma” appears anywhere in
the given string: “Emma is a good developer. Emma is also a writer”
6. Given a two list of ints create a third list such that should contain only
odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list
7. Given 2 strings, s1 and s2, create a new string by appending s2 in the
middle of s1
8. Given 2 strings, s1, and s2 return a new string made of the first, middle
and last char each input string
9. Given a string input Count all lower case, upper case, digits, and special
symbols
10. Find all occurrences of “USA” in given string ignoring the case
11. Given a string, return the sum and average of the digits that appear in
the string, ignoring all other characters
12. Given an input string, count occurrences of all characters within a string
